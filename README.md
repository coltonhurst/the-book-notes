# The Book Notes

This repository contains my notes about [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

These notes are based on [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) (2018 edition) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community. Content, code snippets, and other work from the book are attributed to the original authors and the community.

These notes were compiled by [Colton Hurst](https://www.coltonhurst.com). Hopefully they are helpful to people!
